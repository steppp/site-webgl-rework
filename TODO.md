- avoid showing the actual plane shape when overing with the pointer near its boundaries (use alpha map or something like that?)
- improve boxes geometry quality
- animate main shapes when light is on them
- lock the pointer spotlight on a mesh when it's inside some specific boundaries around that mesh
- add 3d text on top of the page
- improve scene colors and athmosphere
- add resposiveness (for how it's possible)
